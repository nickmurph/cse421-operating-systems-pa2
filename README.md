# Part 2 of the PintOS project for CSE421: Operating Systems

PintOS is a small operating system, written in C, first developed at Stanford for usage in OS coursework. PintOS is deliberately missing several features, implemented by the student in non-contiguous projects. In CSE421, these projects were done in two-student teams. In my particular case, my teammate and I pair-programmed together remotely over Zoom due to Covid restrictions.

Project 2 implements the following:
- Argument passing
- Safe Memory Access
- System Call infrastructure
- A set of 13 system calls 
- Process termination messages
- Denying writes to executables
